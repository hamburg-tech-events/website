# Hamburg Tech Events website

This is the initial setup for the Hamburg Tech Events website.

The idea is to have a website where Hamburg developers/technically-inclined folk can find events (online or in-person) to attend. 

This is initially setup for the Twitter Hamburg Tech meetup group, but the idea is to extend it and make it open to anyone to PR their events.
